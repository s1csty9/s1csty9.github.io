<h1>s1csty9's Minecraft escape room </h1>
<h3>Welcome to my first ever minecraft escape room! It's a prison-break themed adventure map, with a lot of puzzles and cool mechanics. I had a lot of fun making this, and I hope you enjoy playing it! You can download the file through the link below, good luck and have fun!</h3>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Is this hard?</h3>
<h4>I made the map to be rather difficult, but I intentionally didn't make it too hard so most players should be able to beat it quickly with some effort. If you are having trouble, just keep looking around.</h4>
<h3><br>It's too dark! Can you fix this?</h3>
<h4>I intended for the darkness to be a mechanic in the map so that players would utilise management of the limited light sources they are given. I built it based off of the default brightness in Minecraft, and I carefully positioned external light sources to dimly light up key areas if needed. If it's too dark still, try turning up your game brightness. You can use mods that default brightness to max, but they will effectively make you skip parts of the map you have to figure out.</h4>
<h3><br>What versions of Minecraft can I play the map on?</h3>
<h4>I made the map on 1.7.2, so you can play it on 1.7.2 or any version released after up to the latest release.</h4>
<h3><br>Can I record myself playing this and post it on Youtube?</h3>
<h4>Yes, that would be great! I'd love to see people posting their attempts on beating the map online, so please contact me if you do! I'd only ask you to kindly post a link to this page on your video</h4>
<h3><br>Can I reupload the map to curseforge/planet minecraft etc, or share it on a cloud drive?</h3>
<h4>No.</h4>
